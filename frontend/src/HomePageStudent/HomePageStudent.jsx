Paragraphs are a concept that people are expected to learn during their high school years but people fail to grasp the importance of paragraph length. This is not an issue that I have seen on student papers but also on academic papers submitted to journals and conferences.

So what is a long paragraph? It is a paragraph that feels a bit much but if I were to summarize it, here’s two identifiers:

Paragraph consisting typically of more than 8 sentences.
Paragraph that is not coherent.
These are not rigid rules to be followed but rather guidelines where you need to at least ponder on whether you paragraph is unjustly too long.

So what about coherence? Do not pack a bunch of content into one paragraph. For example, if you are listing a bunch 3–4 papers and their findings in a paragraph, it is acceptable to do so as long as you stay within e.g., 8 sentences. The further away that you are getting from this flexible target, the more likely it is that your paragraph is becoming too long. For example, in literature review a section make look like this:


This expansion typically is in part due to the fact that especially in literature review sections, people tend to want to mention things about the referenced papers (often more than what is required). If a single paper that you are citing is summarized in 4–5 sentences then chances are it requires its own paragraph. But then the paragraphs may look as if they are appearing out of the blue. How do you fix that? You can use an intro paragraph for your subsection like the image below.


It is a handy trick that can be used and highly effective for most sections of a research paper.

Detecting long paragraphs automatically
That got me wondering, is there an automated way to tell if your paragraphs are too long? Two applications that I am familiar with and can do this is Grammarly and Citasion although you need to use their premium version to get this feature (free versions have some features but not related to long paragraphs). Grammarly (starting $12/month) has no trial available for testing. Citasion (starting $2.99/month) has a three month trial for its premium features.

I decided to test each on 3 texts that are intentionally too long. To simplify things, I used paragraphs from Wikipedia articles that were contiguous and just merged them into a larger paragraph.

The first article was about earthquakes:


Original two paragraphs from Wikipedia’s Earthquake article.

Editing the paragraph on Overleaf. Citasion prompting me to split the paragraph roughly around the right location.
Above you can see a long paragraph generated out of two paragraphs from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake. The suggestion to split the long paragraph as given by Citasion is one sentence away from that of the original article. Grammarly did not provide a suggestion for splitting this paragraph.

Next up, memory management:


Wikipedia article on Memory Management

Merged paragraphs and Citasion’s recommendation for splitting the paragraph.
In this case, Citasion detected that the paragraph was not cohesive enough and placed the suggested splitting location slightly further. Reading through the text, it is plausible that the second paragraph could have been split later given that the earlier sentence could be seen as introductory. Grammarly’s suggestion for splitting the paragraph was also on the same exact location.

Final attempt, kicking it up a notch, a text in Mandarin (language that I am not a speaker of):


Segment from an article on solar energy on the Chinese version of Wikipedia (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%AA%E9%98%B3%E8%83%BD)

Merged paragraphs and the recommendation to split them from Citasion.
The paragraphs came from the Chinese version of Wikipedia on solar energy (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%AA%E9%98%B3%E8%83%BD). Notice the mix of Latin and Hanzi characters as well as the various punctuation symbols. There are 6 sentences in this paragraph (2 + 4 from the original two paragraphs) but the text talks about two different things (according to Google Translate). Much to my surprise, Citasion detected the difference and suggested the split, one sentence away from where the original split was. Grammarly did not suggest any paragraph splitting.

For all these examples, once the paragraphs were split, no further suggestions for splitting were prompted by either Citasion or Grammarly.

Conclusion
So, what have we learned today? Be mindful about your paragraphs. They can be too long and difficult to read. Splitting is the simplest and easiest way for solving this issue. You can add a few “intro” and “outro” sentences to improve readability when splitting alone won’t cut it. And, if you are uncertain about which paragraphs need splitting, there are tools out there that can help automate this process for you. I can only hope that I won’t see another 15 sentence long paragraph in a paper again but if I do, now there is an article that I can prompt people to read in order to correct their behavior.
